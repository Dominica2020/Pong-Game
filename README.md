# Pong-Game

## Project 22 of 100 Days of Code
- Used python Turtle library to create the classic pong game
- Coded as a two-player game with a scoreboard for each player
- When ball hits a paddle it slightly speeds up to add more challenge
- If ball hits the upper or lower boundaries it will bounce back
- Opposite player scores a point if other player misses a paddle and the ball goes out of bounds
- The game ends when a player reaches 10 points and states the winner
